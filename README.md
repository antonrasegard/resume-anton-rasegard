# CV Website

This is a resume website made from a Code Institute template and for Anton Raseg√•rd; the marvellous Swedish multi talent.

## Usage

Use it as a template for making your own resume website, with edits for name and skill set. However, this is not my original template. All credits go to my dear tutors at Code Institute.

## Aid

I got every little detail of help for the basis of this website from Code Institute. The flag was collected from https://flagicons.lipis.dev/, so big shoutout to them as well. Pictures and CV are naturally my own and copyright credits therefore to me, myself and I.

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome, but unnecessary. This serves as a possibility for me to use an interactive website as my resume instead of just a boring paper version. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.
